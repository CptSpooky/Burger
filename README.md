With the Burger App users can create a burger and devour it! It utilizes node.js, express, express route and handlebars as well as the MCV structure. In the future I might dress up the CSS but right now I'm more concerned with something that functions.

## Installation
To install, you just need to download the files, go into your terminal and make sure you're in the right directory and you have node.js installed, then run 'npm i'. That should install all modules.

## Usage
Locally: In the same directory as the server.js file, type 'node server.js' in your terminal to run the program. Write the new burger name into the form, click "add burger" to see your burger pop up on the list. Click its "devour" button to move it to the devoured list. Once devoured you can't have it back- you ate it!. Don't forget to put in your password in between the quotes inside the Database.js file! If on Heroku just follow the second half of these instructions.
